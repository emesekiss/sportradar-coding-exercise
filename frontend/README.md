# Sportradar Coding Exercise

This React app was created for sportradar's coding challenge for the frontend. To display the date and time in the correct format I used 'date-fns' library.

## List of Features

- landing page with the list of sport events sorted by date
- user can add new sport event and delete existing ones
- filter option based on sport category
